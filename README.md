# Linux 
## What is Linux
Linux is a family of open-source and free operating systems built on the Linux kernel, by Linus Torvalds. 
Linux is built upon UNIX.
UNIX was an operating system back in the 60s and 70s used by programmers and employees. It was written in Assembly Language by AT&T.
The interesting key to UNIX was that it was portable and light enough to be ran on most computers, big or small. 
Due to an anti-trust suite that forbid AT&T to enter the software business, it would license out the source code of UNIX to other users and academic circles.
Overtime, UNIX became a standard rather than a used operating system. An operating system like macOS is defined as UNIX by its standards.
Linux is a derivative of UNIX. It was created to circumvent the proprietary UNIX, which is still trademarked.
Linux operating systems are allowed to be freely distributed, modified, and ran. 
One of the most popular versions of Linux is Ubuntu.

## Linux Terminal Commands
Linux comes with a program known as the "terminal shell".
It allows you to manipulate and change files in the system with text commands.
