#How Internet Works

## **DNS** (Domain Name System) - it maintains a directory of domain names and translates them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
## **IP** (Internet Protocol)-  unique number for every machine using the internet (computer, phone, router, etc.) 
##  This unique number is written as a string of numbers separated by periods. 
##  There are two standards for IP addresses: IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6).
##  IP address helps all internet devices to connect, find, send, and exchange information with other internet devices. 
## **Domain Name** - readable form of IP address and the part of a network address that identifies it as belonging to a particular domain (website). Example: www.example.com.
## **Top Level Domains (TLD)** - the last part of the domain name. The TLD is the letters immediately following the final dot in an Internet address. 
## (Example: .org, .com. .edu, etc.)
