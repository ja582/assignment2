#How Internet Works

## **DNS** (Domain Name System) - it maintains a directory of domain names and translates them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
## **IP** (Internet Protocol)-  unique number for every machine using the internet (computer, phone, router, etc.) 
##  This unique number is written as a string of numbers separated by periods. 
##  There are two standards for IP addresses: IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6).
##  IP address helps all internet devices to connect, find, send, and exchange information with other internet devices. 
## **Domain Name** - readable form of IP address and the part of a network address that identifies it as belonging to a particular domain (website). Example: www.example.com.
## **Top Level Domains (TLD)** - the last part of the domain name. The TLD is the letters immediately following the final dot in an Internet address. 
## (Example: .org, .com. .edu, etc.)   
## Examples and meaning of TLD
## .edu       Educational organization (most US universities)
## .k12       US school site (not all US schools use this)
## .ac         Academic institution (outside of US)
## .sch        School site (some schools outside of the US use this)
## .com       Company (usually .co in the UK)
## .org        Any organization
## .gov       Government agency
## .net        Network
## .mil        Military institution

## ****How to read web address:**** 
##Each page on the internet has a unique address that is identified by the URL. URL - Uniform Resource Locator.
## Knowing what each of the basic elements are in a URL will help to identify the type of website and its purpose.
## Example: _http://www.njit.edu_
## 1. http - HyperText Transfer Protocol - The website is a hypertext document.  
## Hypertext is a nonlinear system of writing that allows users to access text and multimedia features through multiple pathways.
## 2. www - World Wide Web - Website that is on the World Wide Web. 
## WWW - an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
## 3. njit is Domain Name - identifies and calls up the specific computer on the Web that stores the information you requested. 
## 4. .edu is TLD - Indicates the type of source for a web site.
